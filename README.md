🚦 Smart Density-Based Traffic Light Control System
Using ESP32, IR Sensors & Blynk IoT
This project implements an intelligent traffic light management system using the ESP32 microcontroller, IR sensors, and the Blynk IoT platform. Unlike traditional timer-based traffic lights, this system dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time vehicle density, improving traffic flow efficiency.

📌 Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a smart, automated, and IoT-enabled traffic control system that:

Detects real-time vehicle presence using IR sensors
Adjusts signal durations dynamically
Eliminates unnecessary waiting at empty lanes
Sends traffic light status to the Blynk IoT dashboard
Enhances overall traffic flow and reduces congestion
🧠 Key Features
🚗 Density-based light switching
💡 Real-time traffic monitoring
📱 Blynk IoT integration
🌐 WiFi-enabled ESP32 controller
⚡ Efficient signal sequencing
📉 Reduces idle lane time by ~35%
🔌 Low-cost and scalable design

⚠ Note: GPIO1 is also a TX pin. Avoid using Serial Monitor when that LED is ON.

🌐 Blynk IoT Setup
Create a new Template in Blynk
Select ESP32 as hardware
Create Virtual Datastreams:
V1 → Signal 1 Red
V2 → Signal 1 Green
V3 → Signal 2 Red
V4 → Signal 2 Green
Add LED widgets to the dashboard
Copy the Auth Token into your ESP32 code
🔍 System Workflow
IR sensors detect the presence of vehicles
If traffic is detected on Lane 1 → Signal 1 turns green
If traffic is detected on Lane 2 → Signal 2 turns green
If no traffic → Both remain red
Blynk updates show real-time light status
This improves traffic management and reduces unnecessary waiting.

🖥 Circuit Diagram
The circuit includes two IR sensors connected as inputs and two traffic signal LED sets connected as outputs through appropriate resistors.
